# Post 4: A Thought on Consistency

### February 26, 2025

Lately, I've been thinking about how consistency shapes growth. It’s not about huge leaps forward but the small, steady steps. Whether it's coding, art, or just life—showing up matters. The more I stick to my routines, the more I notice subtle changes. It’s like planting seeds—nothing happens overnight, but with time, things start to grow.

Sometimes, it’s hard to see progress when you’re in the middle of it. I’ve been looking back at older projects and notes, and it’s wild how much perspective changes with time. Small wins, daily habits, and a bit of patience—this is the recipe I’m trying to stick to.
